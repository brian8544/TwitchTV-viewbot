# TwitchTV-viewbot
This repository aims to raise awareness about the potential misuse and ease of development of Python-based viewbotting tools within the Twitch platform. While viewbotting violates Twitch's Terms of Service and undermines the integrity of the platform, it is essential to understand the accessibility of these tools to address the issue effectively.
