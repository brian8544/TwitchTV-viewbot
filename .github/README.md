# Twitch.TV viewbot

## Introduction

This repository aims to raise awareness about the potential misuse and ease of development of Python-based viewbotting tools within the Twitch platform. While viewbotting violates Twitch's Terms of Service and undermines the integrity of the platform, it is essential to understand the accessibility of these tools to address the issue effectively.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to showcase the simplicity of creating a basic viewbot using Python, highlighting the potential for abuse and the need for stronger countermeasures. By demonstrating how easily such tools can be developed, we hope to emphasize the urgency of implementing robust security measures to protect the integrity of Twitch's viewership metrics.

## Repository Contents

- `main.py`: The Python source code for the simple viewbot. This code serves as an example to showcase how viewbotting can be achieved using minimal coding knowledge and readily available libraries.
